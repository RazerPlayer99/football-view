# UI Mockups

Drop HTML mockup files here for Claude to read and implement.

## Workflow

1. **Create your mockup** - Design your UI in HTML/CSS
2. **Drop the file here** - Save as `mockups/my-feature.html`
3. **Ask Claude** - "Read the mockup in `mockups/my-feature.html` and implement it"

## Example

```
mockups/
├── predicted-lineup.html    # Lineup display design
├── match-card-v2.html       # Updated match card design
└── player-comparison.html   # Side-by-side player stats
```

Then tell Claude:
> "Read `mockups/predicted-lineup.html` and implement that design in the dashboard"

## Tips

- Include inline CSS in your mockups for easy extraction
- Use placeholder data that matches the real data structure
- Add comments to highlight key design decisions
